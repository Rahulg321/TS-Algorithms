Here are some of the most commonly asked design patterns in technical interviews and those every developer should know:

---

### **1. Creational Patterns**
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, improving flexibility and reuse of existing code.

#### **a. Singleton Pattern**
- Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Common Use Case**: Logging, configuration, thread pools, caches.

#### **b. Factory Method**
- Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Common Use Case**: When the exact type of the object depends on some condition.

#### **c. Abstract Factory**
- Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Common Use Case**: Cross-platform UI components.

#### **d. Builder**
- Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- **Common Use Case**: Constructing objects with many optional parameters.

#### **e. Prototype**
- Creates new objects by copying an existing object.
- **Common Use Case**: When object creation is expensive and cloning is a faster alternative.

### **2. Structural Patterns**
Structural patterns deal with the composition of objects or classes to form larger structures.

#### **a. Adapter**
- Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
- **Common Use Case**: Bridging incompatible interfaces (e.g., legacy code integration).

#### **b. Decorator**
- Adds responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Common Use Case**: Adding features to GUI components.

#### **c. Proxy**
- Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Common Use Case**: Lazy initialization, security proxies, or remote object access.

#### **d. Facade**
- Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code.
- **Common Use Case**: Providing a unified API for a complex subsystem.

#### **e. Composite**
- Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Common Use Case**: File systems, UI component hierarchies.

#### **f. Flyweight**
- Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects.
- **Common Use Case**: Caching, text rendering.

### **3. Behavioral Patterns**
Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects.

#### **a. Strategy**
- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Common Use Case**: Sorting algorithms, payment methods.

#### **b. Observer**
- Defines a dependency between objects such that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Common Use Case**: Event handling systems.

#### **c. Command**
- Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Common Use Case**: Undo/redo functionality.

#### **d. State**
- Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Common Use Case**: Finite state machines.

#### **e. Mediator**
- Reduces the communication complexity between multiple objects or classes.
- **Common Use Case**: Chat applications, traffic control systems.

#### **f. Chain of Responsibility**
- Passes a request along a chain of handlers until it is handled.
- **Common Use Case**: Logging frameworks, event bubbling in UI.

#### **g. Template Method**
- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Common Use Case**: Workflow processes.

#### **h. Iterator**
- Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Common Use Case**: Iterating over collections like arrays or lists.

---

### **4. Concurrent Patterns**
Patterns for dealing with multi-threading and concurrency.

#### **a. Producer-Consumer**
- Separates work into producers (who create tasks) and consumers (who execute tasks).
- **Common Use Case**: Thread pools, message queues.

#### **b. Singleton with Double-Checked Locking**
- Ensures thread-safe lazy initialization of a singleton.
- **Common Use Case**: Resource initialization.

#### **c. Future/Promise**
- Represents a value that may be available at some point in the future.
- **Common Use Case**: Asynchronous computations.

#### **d. Circuit Breaker**
- Prevents an application from trying to perform an operation that's likely to fail.
- **Common Use Case**: Handling fault tolerance in distributed systems.

### **Tips for Interviews**
1. **Understand the Pattern**: Be ready to explain the intent, structure, and use cases of each pattern.
2. **Code Examples**: Practice implementing key patterns in a language you’re comfortable with.
3. **Trade-offs**: Be prepared to discuss when and why you would or wouldn’t use a pattern.
4. **Real-World Applications**: Think of examples from popular frameworks or libraries that use these patterns.

Would you like detailed examples or code implementations for any of these patterns?
