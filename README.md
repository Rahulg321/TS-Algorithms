## Introduction

This repository is a personal learning journey through the world of algorithms and data structures. It contains implementations, explanations, and solutions to various problems, all written in TypeScript. The goal is to provide a resource for myself and others to learn, practice, and improve algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `/algorithms`: Contains implementations of various algorithms
- `/data-structures`: Includes different data structure implementations
- `/problems`: Solutions to algorithmic problems from various sources
- `/design-patterns`: Examples of common design patterns
- `/strategies`: Reusable problem-solving strategies and techniques

Each directory contains its own README with more specific information about its contents.

## Algorithms

The `/algorithms` directory includes implementations of various algorithms, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- Greedy algorithms

## Data Structures

The `/data-structures` directory contains implementations of various data structures, including:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

## Problem Solving

The `/problems` directory includes solutions to algorithmic problems from various sources such as:

- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- Project Euler
- Coding interviews

Each problem includes the problem statement, solution, and an explanation of the approach.

## Design Patterns

The `/design-patterns` directory showcases implementations of common design patterns, including:

- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns

Each pattern includes an example implementation and an explanation of its use case.

## Common Strategies

The `/strategies` directory contains reusable problem-solving strategies and techniques, such as:

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation
